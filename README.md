# fusion-iso-post V1.0
## Post processor for Autodesk Fusion to Biesse ISO format (for Rover and Multi machines)

### Warning

This code is for noncommercial study and simulation only. Each model of CNC machine is different and any post processor must be adapted for safe use on your machine, prior to use. See license for details.

Additional terms:

1. You agree that none of the output of this post processor will not be run on a physical CNC machine.
2. You agree that the output of this postprocessor may only be run in a simulator that is installed on a
   device such as a desktop or laptop PC that is not part of, or connected to, a physical CNC machine.
3. You accept sole responsibility for any loss or damage caused to any party who uses the output of this 
   post processor that was created by you while using this post processor.
4. You agree that the licensor will in no event by liable to you for any loss, damage or injury, including
any damage to a physical or virtual CNC machine or workpiece or CNC machine warranty arising from the 
use of this post processor.

### Features

- Supports simultaneous 5-axis, 3+2 axis, and 3-axis machining on Biesse CNC machines compatible with the ISO format (such as Rover and Multi models).
- Supports the vertical drill block
- Supports Manual NC commands
- Options for controlling vacuum table, dust extractor, workpiece positioning, panel lifting bars and compressed air blower

### Important notes

This code was developed against a mid-2020s Biesse Rover A, but has not been validated for this machine or other Biesse machines.
Use of this post processor may risk damage such as collisions - see license for details.

### Limitations

- Horizontal drills are not supported
- B axis is hardcoded to -100 to +100 degree range
- Metric only
- Sawing operations are not supported
- Drilling operations are hardcoded to retract by 50mm inbetween each drilling operation

### Use

- Do not run ISO files generated by this post processor on a physical CNC machine. Doing so violates the license and risks damage to the machine.
- Co-ordinates - In Fusion, position the WCS (world co-ordinate system) triad at the 'back left bottom corner' of the stock with the 'Z' axis pointing 'up' and the 'Y' axis pointing towards the back of the machine. (Not 'Z'=down and 'Y'='towards front of machine' like on the physical machine). 
- The post processor will compensate for this and the ISO file will be usable at any origin supported by the machine.
- Dust extractor - To avoid risk of collisions, always set the extractor position to 1 (top).
- Do not use this post processor with a machine definition set in Fusion.
